I found on Github VincentTide had done a similar program. I read over his coding and looked at his finished product and like the design. 
Upon more research, I found RyanCunninghams rental calculator in Github and liked his better. His coding is more comprehensive and related to the material we have covered in class. I have decided to use his coding for the basis of my project.
